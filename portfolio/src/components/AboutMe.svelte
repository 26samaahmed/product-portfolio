    I’m a senior at Cal State Fullerton majoring in Computer Science, where I’ve had the opportunity to lead teams, co-direct FullyHacks 2025, and serve as web lead for FullyBeyond 2024, our first student-run designathon. Beyond school, I spent the summer as a User Experience Researcher at LPL Financial, where I discovered how much I enjoy <em>shaping products by connecting user insights to real design and engineering decisions</em>.
    What excites me most about product management is being part of the <em>entire journey</em> — from defining a problem to seeing a solution make a difference for users. I love collaborating with diverse teams, <em>asking the right questions</em>, and turning ideas into products that people actually enjoy using.
